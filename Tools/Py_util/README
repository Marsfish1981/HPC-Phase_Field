
fsnapshot


Provides a simple interface to data in a "plotfile" generated using the CCSE BoxLib software (see https://ccse.lbl.gov/).  In particular, fsnapshot routines can be compiled into a python-loadable shared library in order to provide access to plotfile data at the python prompt.

The interface library can be generated using "f2py", and requires linking to compiled objects from the Fortran version of the base BoxLib classes.  A GNUmakefile is provided in this folder as an example of how to do this from "scratch" (ie, by compiling a complete set of the required objects, and linking them together to form the library file, "fsnapshot.so").

An example python script using some of the fsnapshot routines is included in this folder, called "plotsinglevar.py".

If you run into problems trying to use these tools, you can contact Marc Day at MSDay@lbl.gov for help.

PS: The source code, makefile and example were all copied almost verbatim from the CCSE git repo, "AmrPostprocessing".  They were put here to allow distribution with the base libraries for convenience, and there is a distinct possiblity that the two versions will occasionally be out of sync.
